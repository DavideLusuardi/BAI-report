\section{Introduction}
\IEEEPARstart{C}{omputer games} have been linked with artificial intelligence (AI) from its inception.
Video games implement rich and complex environments that usually require a real-time
response by the player and a dynamic strategy with an adaptive behavior in order to get a
good score or win.

Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are computational learning systems inspired by biological
neural networks that use a network of functions to understand and translate some input data
into a desired output. An ANN is based on a collection of connected units or nodes called
artificial neurons, each neuron may be in principle connected to all the others. We can
differentiate the neurons in three categories: input neurons, which receives the input data from 
the environment; hidden neurons, which elaborates the input data; output neurons, which outputs the desired output.

They are being deployed in a variety of tasks including playing computer games, but a core
problem with the standard training approach is that we do not know a priori the best
structure and we may have to try a lot of different architectures before finding the one that
performs well. NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) \cite{NEAT} is a genetic
algorithm, an example of a topology and weight evolving artificial neural network (TWEANN),
which attempts to simultaneously learn weight values and an appropriate topology
for a neural network. In our implementation \cite{repository}, NEAT is used to evolve an ANN that is
evaluated during the game to output the action the agent has to perform.

Genetic Programming (GP) \cite{GP} is a technique used to generate computer programs. Starting
from an initial population of programs, the GP algorithm will evolve them in order to solve
predescribed tasks and machine learning problems. In our implementation
\cite{repository}, GP evolves computer programs represented as tree structures, that are evaluated
recursively during the game to output the action the agent has to perform.
