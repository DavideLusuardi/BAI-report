\begin{abstract}
  Game playing was an area of research in AI from its inception. 
  Video games offer an amazingly interesting testbed for AI research and new ideas. 
  The aim of this report is to show the potential of NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies and Genetic Programming
  in solving the Yellow-Spaceship game and compare the two strategies. 
  We found out that both are very good approaches and managed to find a way to play the game well. 
  Even though, across multiple runs, NEAT seems to obtain more stable results, GP has demonstrated to have 
  a bigger potential thanks to the tree-structured individuals and overall manages to reach very good results.
